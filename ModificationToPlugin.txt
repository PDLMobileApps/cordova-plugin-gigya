Base: Gigya Cordova SDK 3.6.6 (using gigya-sdk.jar version 3.3.34 and GigyaSDK.framework from version 3.7.5).


We had to do the following to prevent the build from failing because of missing Gradle dependencies:
- Add
    -dontwarn com.gigya.socialize.android.login.providers.**
  to the res/assets/android/proguard-rules.txt (for missing com.linecorp.linesdk and com.tencent.mm.opensdk dependencies)



Modification to the original plugin:
- Add AppDelegate handler in src/ios/GigyaConnectPlugin.m - 2nd gigya_swizzled_application function. This is needed to allow auto login via Google
(otherwise the customer has to sign in on Google every time the app is launched after being killed)



Replaced iOS framework with xcframework:
- Go to cordova-plugin-gigya/src/ios/libs

- Execute scripts/ios/xcframeworkconversion.sh

- Delete GigyaSDK.framework

- Edit plugin.xml and replace iOS framework with xcframework: <framework src="src/ios/libs/GigyaSDK.xcframework" custom="true"/>
