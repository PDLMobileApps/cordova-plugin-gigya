Base: Gigya Cordova SDK 3.6.5 (using gigya-sdk.jar version 3.3.33 and GigyaSDK.framework from version 3.7.5).


We had to do the following to prevent the build from failing because of missing Gradle dependencies:
- Add
    -dontwarn com.gigya.socialize.android.login.providers.**
  to the res/assets/android/proguard-rules.txt (for missing com.linecorp.linesdk and com.tencent.mm.opensdk dependencies)


We had to make the following modification to the original plugin:
- Add AppDelegate handler in src/ios/GigyaConnectPlugin.m - 2nd gigya_swizzled_application function. This is needed to allow auto login via Google
(otherwise the customer has to sign in on Google every time the app is launched after being killed)
