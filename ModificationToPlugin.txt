Base: Gigya Cordova SDK 3.6.2 (using gigya-sdk.jar version 3.3.28 and GigyaSDK.framework from version 3.6.0).


We had to do the following to prevent the build from failing because of missing Gradle dependencies:
- Add
    -dontwarn com.gigya.socialize.android.login.providers.**
  to the res/assets/android/proguard-rules.txt (for missing com.linecorp.linesdk and com.tencent.mm.opensdk dependencies)


We had to do the following modification to the original plugin:
- Update src/ios/libs/GigyaSDK.framework from version 3.6.13 to version 3.7.3
- Update src/Android/libs/gigya-sdk.jar from version 3.3.28 to version 3.3.31
- Add AppDelegate handler in src/ios/GigyaConnectPlugin.m - 2nd gigya_swizzled_application function. This is needed to allow auto login via Google
(otherwise the customer has to sign in on Google every time the app is launched after being killed)
